# Big-Data-Bowl
Using NFL NextGenStats data, we were able to cluster wide receiver routes based on positional tracking data using R. We were also able to identify the best receiver-route combinations in the NFL last season. Check out our full paper or the code used to create our clusters. Data from https://github.com/nfl-football-ops/Big-Data-Bowl/tree/master/Data and NFL Big Data Bowl themes and rules on https://operations.nfl.com/the-game/big-data-bowl/. Received an Honorable Mention from the NFL.
